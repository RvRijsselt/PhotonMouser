# PhotonMouser
Robot mouse build around a Particle Photon. This was a Sinterklaas present including a poem and control panel which was hosted on a website. The robot itself was dressed in a nice Mouse-like costume.

Mouser.ino was a first attempt to control the mouse, play a song. It basically tries to follow an object that is in front of the sensor. Failed to make it also move forward backwards so started a new version 2, MouserV2.ino, with some code reused from the web.
